"""

The number of dimensions needs to be the same if you want to concatenate two arrays with np.concatenate(). 
As such, if you want to concatenate an array with my_array, which is 1-D, you’ll need to make sure that the
 second array that you have, is also 1-D.
With np.vstack(), you effortlessly combine my_array with my_2d_array. You just have to make sure that, as you’re 
stacking the arrays row-wise, that the number of columns in both arrays is the same. As such, you could also add
 an array with shape (2,4) or (3,4) to my_2d_array, 
as long as the number of columns matches. Stated differently, the arrays must have the same shape along all but 
the first axis. The same holds also for when you want to use np.r[].
For np.hstack(), you have to make sure that the number of dimensions is the same and that the number of rows in
 both arrays is the same. That means that you could stack arrays such as (2,3) or (2,4) to my_2d_array, which 
 itself as a shape of (2,4). Anything is possible as long as you make sure that the number of rows matches.
  This function is still supported by NumPy, but you should prefer np.concatenate() or np.stack().
